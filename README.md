# Interoception
Many aspects of the task are customizable including but not limited to: range of BPM, speed of beats, bpm that begins upon load, colors, sizes, etc. 
The ideal range should be set to 1-x number beats per minute. Setting the range to 0 at the mininum can cause a glitch with the code. Instead I reccomend a "I cannot feel anything button". This is a more valid way at getting at no cardioception rather than having the child figure out they're supposed to make the beating stop.
