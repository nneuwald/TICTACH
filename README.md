# Interoception

The current task has a minimum beat rate of 10 and a maximum beat rate of 200. The interval between tasks is set at 30 seconds except for post baseline 3 which requires user pressing spacebar to proceed. 
Functions: Spacebar- skips to next task
escape key, ends task and generates output
backpace key- returns to beginning of TICTOC task
arrow keys- moves slider 1 bpm to the left or right

The output generated will show initial slider position -> final slider position and time taken for each task in ms. 

many aspects of the task are customizable including but not limited to: range of BPM, speed of beats, bpm that begins upon load, colors, sizes, etc. 
The ideal range should be set to 1-x number beats per minute. Setting the range to 0 at the mininum can cause a glitch with the code. Instead I reccomend a "I cannot feel anything button". This is a more valid way at getting at no cardioception rather than having the child figure out they're supposed to make the beating stop.
